##  About Me

Hey there! Iâ€™m Justin â€” a data nerd who loves building practical solutions that actually make a difference.

Over the past 3+ years, Iâ€™ve worked on everything from fixing sudden sales dips in CPG companies to deploying machine learning models that forecast equity values and CPG product demand for Fortune 100 companies. I enjoy solving messy problems end-to-end â€” whether it's setting up real-time streaming data pipelines from scratch or figuring out why a campaign flopped.

Now, Iâ€™m deep into my masterâ€™s in Business Analytics at the University of Minnesota, continuing to sharpen both the business and technical edges.

##  What I Do

Iâ€™m kind of a **jack-of-all-data-trades** â€” part data scientist, part analyst, part builder. Here's a quick breakdown of what Iâ€™ve been up to:

###  At Tredence Analytics
-  Built and deployed forecasting models for equity and product demand
-  Designed streaming data pipelines and warehouses â€” end-to-end
-  Created a Power BI dashboard with custom KPIs for C-suite stakeholders
-  Investigated a sudden sales crash in Thailand (and explained it!)
-  Worked directly with clients, bridging technical and business needs

###  Hackathons, Research & Fun Projects
-  2nd Place â€“ **MinneMUDAC 2025** â€“ Predicted mentorship longevity using NLP and census data  
-  2nd Place â€“ **Analytics for Good Hackathon 2025** â€“ Showed how a chatbot helped boost student grades using causal inference  
-  1st Place - **Live Case Competition Carson School Of Management** Researched the impact of NCAAâ€™s NIL policy using DiD  
-  On Kaggle when I can â€” mostly time series, NLP, and anything that breaks my brain a bit

###  When I'm Not Coding...
Youâ€™ll probably find me in the gym or throwing punches in the boxing ring. Discipline, reps, and resilience â€” whether itâ€™s weight training or training models, I love both.
