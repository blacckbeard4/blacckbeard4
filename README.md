## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I’m Justin — a data nerd who loves building practical solutions that actually make a difference.

Over the past 3+ years, I’ve worked on everything from fixing sudden sales dips in CPG companies to deploying machine learning models that forecast equity values and CPG product demand for Fortune 100 companies. I enjoy solving messy problems end-to-end — whether it's setting up real-time streaming data pipelines from scratch or figuring out why a campaign flopped.

Now, I’m deep into my master’s in Business Analytics at the University of Minnesota, continuing to sharpen both the business and technical edges.

## 🔍 What I Do

I’m kind of a **jack-of-all-data-trades** — part data scientist, part analyst, part builder. Here's a quick breakdown of what I’ve been up to:

### 👨‍💻 At Tredence Analytics
- 📉 Investigated a sudden sales crash in Thailand (and explained it!)
- 📈 Built forecasting models for equity and product demand
- 🔄 Designed streaming data pipelines and warehouses — end-to-end
- 📊 Created a Power BI dashboard with custom KPIs for C-suite stakeholders
- 🤝 Worked directly with clients, bridging technical and business needs

### 🧠 Hackathons, Research & Fun Projects
- 🥈 2nd Place – **MinneMUDAC 2025** – Predicted mentorship longevity using NLP and census data  
- 🥈 2nd Place – **Analytics for Good Hackathon 2025** – Showed how a chatbot helped boost student grades using causal inference  
- 🧪 1st Place - **Live Case Competition Carson School Of Management** Researched the impact of NCAA’s NIL policy using DiD  
- 💻 On Kaggle when I can — mostly time series, NLP, and anything that breaks my brain a bit

### 💪 When I'm Not Coding...
You’ll probably find me in the gym or throwing punches in the boxing ring. Discipline, reps, and resilience — whether it’s weight training or training models, I love both.
