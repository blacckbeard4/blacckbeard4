## 🔍 What I Do

I'm a **data detective and solution builder** — part data scientist, part business analyst, and part ML problem-solver.

### 🧠 3 Years @ Tredence Analytics
At Tredence, I delivered data science solutions for Fortune 100 companies:
- 📉 Investigated unexpected sales dips in Thailand
- 📈 Built ML models that forecast **equity prices** and **product demand**
- 🔄 Designed real-time streaming **data pipelines and warehouses from scratch**
- 🤝 Worked end-to-end: EDA → Modeling → MLOps → Business Action

### 🚀 Hackathons, Research & Kaggle
I love building under pressure — fast, creative, and clean:
- 🥈 **2nd Place** – MinneMUDAC 2025 (Mentorship longevity prediction)
- 🥈 **2nd Place** – Analytics for Good 2025 (Causal chatbot impact on grades)
- 🧪 Research – Impact of NIL policies on NCAA basketball performance
- 💻 Kaggle Competitor – Time series, NLP, and CV challenges

### 💪 Outside of Work
I enjoy **boxing**, strength training, and challenging myself both mentally and physically. I believe discipline in training mirrors discipline in execution.
